			<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<h3>Quick Start</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Click Settings</li>
						<li>Choose the Competition</li>
						<li>Click Save</li>
						<li>Go back to the Main Screen, Click Scout</li>
						<li>Scout Matches</li>
					</ol>
				<h3>In-Depth Information</h3>
					<p>In order to use this app, the competition must be set. Doing so allows the software to keep data separate and to download match information.</p>
					<p>After this point, internet access is not <em>required</em>, but <strong>strongly recommended</strong>.</p>
					<p>At this point, matches can be scouted. If match information has been downloaded, then alliance information will be preloaded. However, if there is no internet access when the schedule is generated, this information cannot be downloaded and the alliance infomation must be inserted manually.</p>
					<p>After matches have been scouted, the data can be consolidated onto one app (more info to come, still under development).</p>
					<p>Using the Statistics menu, team members can view and edit collected data, view charts and graphs regarding the data, and view the best fit for alliance selections.</p>
				<h3>Notes Regarding Internet Access</h3>
					<p>Internet Access is required for the selection of the competition. This selection is then used to pull and preload match information (click the message after schedules generated), like alliances.</p>
					<p>If Internet access is not available to download the schedule, then the scouter will have to manually enter the match information.</p>
